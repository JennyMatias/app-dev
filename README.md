Accepting the offer, he is taken to an unknown location where he finds himself among 455 other players who are all in deep financial trouble. The players are made to wear green tracksuits and are kept under watch at all times by masked guards in pink jumpsuits, with the games overseen by the Front Man, who wears a black mask and black uniform.  |
| Sweet home | After an unexpected tragedy kills his entire family and leaves him as the only survivor, Cha Hyun-su leaves his family home and relocates into the run down apartment complex known as Green Home. One night, horrific monsters begin appearing and ravage the city. Hyun-su and some of his fellow residents band together within the confines of the complex and must fight for their survival against the new, otherworldly threat, while others from the apartment turn into monsters based on the things they desire. Hyun-su starts having monster symptoms and develops the ability to turn into a winged monster whenever he desires. |
